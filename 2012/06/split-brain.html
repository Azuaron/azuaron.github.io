<p><em>(Every so often we talk about something really weird in science. See the complete series at <a href="http://azuaron.github.io/category/weird-science/">Weird Science</a>.)</em></p>
<p>Most people are aware that their brains are split into left and right hemispheres. There's a large bundle of nerves that connect the two called the corpus callosum. That's right, the only thing preventing you from having two separate minds living in one skull is a single bundle of nerves.</p>
<p>But it gets weirder. Certain kinds of epilepsy occur because of an uncontrolled propagation of anomalous nerve signals in the brain (also known as "for some reason, electricity in your brain has gone crazy"). These types of epilepsy can often be completely cured by severing the corpus callosum, because the propagation will halt when it tries to bridge the gap between hemispheres and can't.</p>
<p><img src="http://azuaron.github.io/imagesalien-hand.jpg" alt="alien-hand" />Not that kind of alien handSometimes these people will develop things like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_hand_syndrome">alien hand syndrome</a>, where the person becomes convinced that one hand (usually the left) is acting on its own, and contrary to his or her normal behavior. But usually you can meet them, befriend them, and know them for years and never know they have two minds inside one skull.</p>
<p>Psychologists, however, know how to test split-brain patients in very specific ways. For the most part, language is handled in the left hemisphere, which means the right hemisphere is essentially mute. Every time you have a thought in a language ("Hmmm... I wonder if I should..."), that's your left hemisphere.</p>
<p>But if your corpus callosum is cut, that essentially means your right hemisphere doesn't have a say (so to speak) in what's going on, but it can still act (using the left side of the body). This puts the left hemisphere in the awkward position of verbally explaining why the right hemisphere did something, and a lot of times the left hemisphere will make a rational explanation even though, really, it has no idea what's going on.</p>
<p><img src="http://azuaron.github.io/imagessplit-brain-chicken-shovel.jpg" alt="split-brain-chicken-shovel" />Split brain patients can choose associated images using both sides of their brains.For instance, the image on the right shows a split-brain patient choosing pictures that are associated with the pictures on the screen in front of him. The left visual field is processed by the right hemisphere, so the left hand (controlled by the right hemisphere) chooses the shovel because of the snow. The right hand chooses the chicken for the chicken foot. But when asked why the choices were made, the patient says the chicken for the chicken foot, and the shovel to clean out the chicken coop. This is because the left hemisphere controls language, but <em>can't see the snowy house</em>, so it just makes up a reason for the shovel.</p>
<h3>The Conscious Mind</h3>
<p>And this is where most people's idea of the "conscious mind" kind of falls apart. Most people consider the conscious mind the language part of the brain: I think this sentence, I am conscious of the sentence I just thought, that is my conscious mind (goes all the back to "I think, therefore I am"). But that only accounts for half (at most) of our conscious mind: the left hemisphere, and it's language processing capabilities.</p>
<p>A good example of this is chess masters. When a chess master is playing a match, they don't process it like a computer (continue down every possible set of moves and choose the most advantageous). What they do is "sum up" the game in their mind based on games they've played, games they've seen, and games they've studied, and make a move in a way that the resulting "sum" in their mind is the greatest. This spatial summary is the kind of thing that the right hemisphere does very well, but the left hemisphere couldn't do with a map (mainly because the left hemisphere is also bad with maps).</p>
<p>But despite not thinking in sentences (indeed, many chess masters have difficulty explaining exactly why they make particular moves), I don't think anyone will argue that the chess master wasn't using their conscious mind to make the play.</p>
<h3>What split-brain condition is not</h3>
<p>The split-brain condition is not, in any way, associated with multiple personality disorder (more properly known as dissociative identity disorder). The hemispheres don't take turns "driving" the body and acting as different personalities. Both hemispheres are fully operational and present at all times and "drive" the body simultaneously, the left hemisphere controlling the right of the body and the right hemisphere controlling the left of the body.</p>
<h3>What can I write with this?</h3>
<p>In most media (books, movies, television, videogames), a "crazy" character or brain damaged character acts in a very general kind of "crazy" way. This can range from catatonic and drooling, to gibbering and irrational behavior, to generalized sociopathy. But generally speaking, most people with mental disorders or brain damage have a very specific condition. A phobia. An anxiety disorder. A personality disorder (watch <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009W5CA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=thunwe-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00009W5CA">Fargo</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=thunwe-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00009W5CA" alt="ir_t_thunwe-20_l_as2_o_1_a_B00009W5CA" /> for a good primer on personality disorders).</p>
<p>Mental homogeneity is boring. If someone's insane in your story, break out of the boring and get specific.</p></p>

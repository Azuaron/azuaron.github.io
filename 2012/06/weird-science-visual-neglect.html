				<h1>Weird Science: Visual Neglect</h1>

<p><em>(Every so often we talk about something really weird in science. See the complete series at <a href="http://azuaron.github.io/category/weird-science/">Weird Science</a>.)</em></p>
<p>Imagine if you were blind to everything on your left side. Not blind in your left eye--both of your eyes work fine--but you can't see anything left of in front of you. When presented with the drawing of a cat and asked to reproduce it, you'll draw half a cat (like in the image above).</p>
<p>This condition is called visual neglect, and it can happen because of the strange way we process visual information.</p>
<p><img src="http://azuaron.github.io/imagesvisual-pathway-231x300.gif" alt="Visual pathway" />Pathway of visual informationIn the image on the left, you can see the basic pathway for visual information. What you see on the left (blue) is routed to the right hemisphere, and what you see on the right (red) is routed to the left hemisphere, <strong><em>regardless of which eye it comes from</em></strong>. This division continues as the information is processed by the visual cortex (occipital lobe) and sent on to your brain's sensory processing areas.</p>
<p>The parietal lobe integrates various sensory information and decides what information you focus your attention on. For instance, a blank wall isn't very interesting, so the parietal lobe will push you to focus on the picture hanging in the middle of the wall. Bushes usually aren't very interesting, but it is vitally important to see that leopard stalking through them.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<p><img src="http://azuaron.github.io/imagesrightparietal.png" alt="Right parietal" />The yellow region is the parietal lobe</p>
<p>If the right parietal lobe is damaged, sometimes the information for the left visual field is processed, but then ignored by the broken parietal lobe. This results in an inability to perceive anything in the left visual field.</p>
<h3>Wait, it gets weirder</h3>
<p>It turns out that the brain splits visual information more than just right and left. Feature Integration Theory explains how the brain splits visual information of objects into different pieces (color, shape, orientation, motion, depth, etc.; I won't go very far into Feature Integration Theory, but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_integration_theory">Wikipedia is a good place to find references for it</a>) before reintegrating them into mental models. Damage in the right parietal lobe can disrupt this process, and make it impossible for people to see the left side of any and every object.</p>
<p><img src="http://azuaron.github.io/imagesobject_centered_neglect-220x300.jpg" alt="Visual object neglect" />A patient with visual object neglect tries to draw a yard, and tries to circle all of the closed circles.</p>
<p>You can see in the picture to the left the problems people with visual object neglect have. Despite being able to see a complete field of view, they are unable to perceive the left half of any individual object. The question everyone asks at this point is, "So, what <strong>do</strong> they see?" Unfortunately, there's not a very good answer to that. They aren't able to see <em>through</em> objects, obviously, and they aren't freaked out that everyone only has half of a face (despite only seeing half of everyone's face--including their own). The best analogy I've heard is that it's like thinking about what you can see directly behind your head; you just can't. <em>(If your mind has just been blown, and you think it might be your parietal lobe that has been damaged, please <a href="http://azuaron.github.io/ask-me-your-science-questions/">contact me immediately</a>. Neuroscientists want to talk to you.)</em></p>
<h3>You keep saying "right" parietal lobe and "left" visual field--what happens when the <em>left</em> parietal lobe is damaged?</h3>
<p>Most of the data for visual neglect (and visual object neglect) comes from right-handed people, because the neurophysiology of right-handed people is best understood (because there are more of them to study). Left-handed people have different neurophysiology, and due to the rarity of visual neglect, are not often the subject of study.</p>
<p>With that in mind, right-handed males (typically) use the left parietal lobe for language processing, so it's difficult to find out if they are having visual neglect on their right side when their left parietal is damaged; they have problems speaking/writing and understanding spoken/written language.</p>
<p>Left-handed people tend to distribute their language processing across both parietal lobes, but I am not aware of any studies of parietal lobe damage to a left-handed person, so I don't know what effect that has (if any) on visual neglect or language processing following parietal lobe damage.</p></p>

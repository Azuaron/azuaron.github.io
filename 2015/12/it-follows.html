<p><em>Trigger warning for sex crimes involving children.</em></p>
<h3>The Good</h3>
<p>The monster in <em>It Follows</em> is an intriguing concept; it somehow distills the standard slasher villain into it's most basic components while still feeling entirely new.</p>
<p>The monster is invisible to everyone other than its victims and can, itself, look like anyone. This combination breeds a special brand of paranoia into its victims, since nothing they see can be verified by anyone else <strong>and</strong> their stalker can be <em>literally anyone they see</em>.</p>
<p>True to its name, it follows. No matter where you go, it will walk directly toward you. The key word is walk; it's not very fast. You can drive or fly, but it always knows where you are, and will always walk straight toward you. It can't be fooled and, given its super strength, it can't be stopped. Well, I would have actually liked a bit more explanation into this. Like, if you tricked it into jumping into a large pit, then filled that pit with quick drying cement, can it get out of that? How about molten lead? A fair few questions remain outside the scope of the movie. From a more practical standpoint, if you flew to Europe, could it cross the ocean? It seems like this should have been their first plan, but no one tried more than "drive an hour away".</p>
<h3>The Bad</h3>
<p>Now that we're post-<a href="http://amzn.to/1HTMyHi"><em>Cabin In The Woods</em></a>, can we stop using the standard set of protagonists? It's boring. Yes, your "virgin" archetype isn't really a virgin, but she's still the archetype. Oh, your "jock" doesn't actually play sports and is the "bad boy" of the school? The smart guy is also the stoner? Please try harder, or, even, at all.</p>
<p>After the core group gets <a href="https://youtu.be/B_WNViYEjzs?t=11m27s">past the belief curve</a> everything plays out just about how you'd expect; the only surprises are the unintentionally uncomfortable ones (detailed below).</p>
<h3>The Ugly (spoilers ahead)</h3>
<p>How this monster chooses its targets is, well, presumably there was a "patient zero" at one point, we don't know how this thing got started. But it can be transferred to another person by having sex with them. That's right, this is the monster-personification of an STI. The only problem is, transferring it to someone makes it stop coming after you. So, essentially, this monster works via the <strong>real world, pervasive, and dangerous myth</strong> that has sprung up many times around the world: having sex will cure you of your infection. Usually, the myth says it's sex with virgins, which typically means people are raping children to "cure" themselves of the disease. Not only does this fail spectacularly by <em>not</em> curing the infection, but it also <em>spreads the infection</em> and, oh yes, <em>children were raped</em>.</p>
<p>This happened with syphilis in Europe. It's happening right now with HIV in Africa.</p>
<p>I can't tell if the writers were aware of this, or just bumbled into it, but either way it's pretty disgusting that this movie re-enforces the myth that having sex with someone will cure your "infection". It seems like this is probably unintentional; going along with the theme of "distilling the classic slasher villain", then sex has to have negative consequences (because for some reason that trope hasn't died). But this is just gross in all the wrong ways.</p></p>
